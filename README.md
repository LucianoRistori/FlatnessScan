# FlatnessScan

**FlatnessScan** is a C++17 program for analyzing surface flatness from 3D measurement data.  
It reads a CSV-like file of point coordinates, fits an optimal plane to the data, evaluates deviations,  
and visualizes the results as histograms and color maps using the ROOT framework.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Overview

The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Reads** a text file with four columns:  
   `index, X, Y, Z` ‚Äî where `X, Y, Z` are coordinates in millimeters.
   Additional numbers on the same line are ignored.
   Any text is ignored
2. **Fits** a best-fit plane using ROOT‚Äôs Minuit2 minimizer.
3. **Computes** the flatness standard deviation and plane coefficients.
4. **Produces**:
   - 1D histograms for X, Y, Z, and residuals from the plane fit.  
   - A 2D scatter plot of Y vs X.  
   - A **colored flatness map** (Z as color) if the (X,Y) points form a regular grid.
5. **Saves** all histograms and graphs to a ROOT file.
